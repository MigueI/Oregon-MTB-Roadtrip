# Oregon-MTB-Roadtrip

Goal: To compute the fastest roadtrip route for 20 mountainbike trails across Oregon. 

Result: [Oregon MTB Roadtrip Map](http://miguei.github.io/toporegon_map)

Background: I got the idea and part of the code from Randal Olson's phenomenal blog. 
I scraped the top 20 MTB trails in Oregon from [singletracks.com](http://www.singletracks.com/mountain-bike/best_trails.php?new_state_id=418)
since it's one of the few sites that ranks trails at the state level. I had to then modify some of the addresses on a case by 
case basis so the correct destination would be found on google maps.
